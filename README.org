* Alu
Alu is a DSL for writing VAMP-IR Circuits.
** Quick Start
[TODO]

** Developer Environment
_Alucard works on many different implementations of CL, namely_
  + SBCL
  + CCL
  + ECL

*** Setting up SBCL
SBCL by default does not ship a new enough version of ASDF, and you
may encounter an error like
#+begin_src lisp
  * (ql:quickload :alu)

  debugger invoked on a ASDF/FIND-COMPONENT:MISSING-DEPENDENCY-OF-VERSION in thread
  #<THREAD "main thread" RUNNING {1004E58073}>:
    Component "asdf" does not match version 3.3.5, required by #<SYSTEM "alu">

  Type HELP for debugger help, or (SB-EXT:EXIT) to exit from SBCL.

  restarts (invokable by number or by possibly-abbreviated name):
    0: [ABORT                  ] Give up on "alu"
    1: [REGISTER-LOCAL-PROJECTS] Register local projects and try again.
    2:                           Exit debugger, returning to top level.

  (QUICKLISP-CLIENT::AUTOLOAD-SYSTEM-AND-DEPENDENCIES "alu" :PROMPT NIL)

#+end_src
If this occurs you may need to update your asdf to a newer version.

1. Clone the repo: =git clone https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf.git=
2. =cd asdf  && make=
3. In the lisp REPL: =(load "/path/to/asdf/build/asdf.lisp")=
4. put =(load "/path/to/asdf/build/asdf.lisp")= in your =~/.sbclrc=
